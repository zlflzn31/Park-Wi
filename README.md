Park JongWhan and Hong Wi's team project 

This project is for CSE 332, Object-Oriented Software Development Laboratory. 
In this porject, we are assigned to develop a card game that runs Five Card Draw, Texas Holdâ€™em, and Seven Card Stud on the command line. Although this project is for the class assignment, we were very excited to develop a game using C/C++. 

Since we worked this project om Visual Studio 2015, we highly recommend using Visual Studio 2015. Some codes from our porject will not be complied on the newest Visual Studio due to version difference.
