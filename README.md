Park JongWhan and Hong Wi's team project 

This project is for CSE 332, Object-Oriented Software Development Laboratory. 
In this porject, we are assigned to develop a card game that runs Five Card Draw, Texas Holdâ€™em, and Seven Card Stud on the command line. Although this project is for the class assignment, we were very excited to develop a game using C/C++. 

To run the game, please download all files and open them in visual studio.
